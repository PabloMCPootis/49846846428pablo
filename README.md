> ### I'm Pablo; 21 years old, straight and a boy

### My strenghts are:
- Kind of heart
- Sweet and charming
- Supportive
- Intense good feelings
- Curious
- Sensitive
- A  bit artistic / creative?
- Good leadership

### My weakneses are:
- Intense bad feelings
- Unpredictability, I act on impulse
- Easily overwhelmed and stressed
- Overly competitive
- Rollercoaster in self steem, one days i feel on top of the world and others at the bottom
- Extremely clingy and co-dependant
- I can't control anger

### Aspects of my life:
- In relationships, the most important factor is knowing im loved and committed to, anything that threats that stability puts me on a panic mindset. In sex I prioritize my partner's well being and satisfaction over my own, being open minded for my partner's interests and being able to change my power role to fit their needs.
- In friendships I expect them to be reciprocate and active, 50% 50%. Whenever this is not met I get upset and might get an attitude against the person.
- In a job life, I'm highly afraid of not being able to keep at it. If the job becomes ordinary and monotone I might not be able to satisfy what is expected from me, and that gives me anxiety because I dont like letting people down.
- In any group of people, I feel more comfortable being the leader, because, apart from being good at it, it gives me a sense of control over people that makes me feel more comfortable. Sometimes I have an obsession for control, because I know if I control things they wont go wrong, as I'll be able to act on them accordingly.
- The fact that I take the leader role, makes me feel responsible for everyone's well being, and makes me go "dad mode" to protect those who I care about, often resulting in disliking towards me.
- In ideology, I'm a christian believer of the Jehova's Witnesses branch although I don't actively practice religion, and I align with the auth right side of a political compass. I believe in order instead of chaos. Despite chaos being in the human nature, control is a great tool to get rid of it, something most governments don't do or do badly.
- In family, I would like to have kids in a future, but I'm not sure yet if it is the best for them to come to a world this rotten, if I was them I wouldn't want to be born, but still im too young to decide this 100%

### Things I like to do:
- I enjoy building and designing Lego stuff, although I'm not good at designing, I still have peace when I build things with them.
- I enjoy creating things to improve or modify games, like Minecraft of Team Fortress 2.
- I enjoy drawing even when im not good at it, I guess I put my feelings into the canvas and it helps relief the pain, but I get greatly frustrated when I can't draw what I want and it makes me feel horrible.
- I enjoy Star Wars and One Piece and I feel in peace while I'm watching those, like if I somehow knew things are going to be like they used to when I started watching them.
- I enjoy music in many styles, I have a very strong connection to song meanings, and everytime I use a song for something I carefully pick it for its meaning, trying to transfer that to the person I send it to.
- I have a passion for dogs and I want one, although I don't think its a good idea.

### Things I dislike:
- I dislike when animals are hurt.
- I greatly dislike and despise any subproduct of the political left, as I believe their goal is to stablish chaos and degeneracy into the world.
- I dislike feeling abandoned or left apart, makes me feel unworthy and disposable.
- I dislike being told what to do.
- I greatly dislike doing things I don't want to do and I usually take the shortest path to get them done as fast as posible. Being forced into things makes me grow inner bad feelings towards what im forced to.
- I'm too kind and people take advantage of me.

### How I feel:
- Most of the time I feel life is not for me, that is too hard for someone like me. All these bad things that affect me so much, and I don't feel strong enough to survive an average of 80 years when I struggled this much just with 20.
- I don't feel connected to my family, they are just people I don't hate but don't fully love either and this comes from when I was a baby.
- I very often put on a tough guy mask when in reality I'm extremely sensitive. Emotions affect me a lot, and I can't control that effect they have. This causes me to give the cold shoulder or keep a distance when I feel my bond with someone is tearing apart, so when it finally breaks I don't suffer that much.
- I know I'm never going to reach a point when I can fully say I'm happy anymore, just isolated experiences that give short and temporary joy.
- The moment I can't even have those brief moments of joy, will be the day I'll be ready to leave.

### Quotes I live by:
>No one deserves your true good self unless they fight to earn it.

>Eye for an eye.

>No one's either fully good or fully bad, we all do good and bad things that we are more or less proud of, regret is the game changing.

>The enemy of my enemy is my ally.

>Never fuck someone who has nothing left to lose.

>Put on a good show before leaving something forever.

>My opinion, ethics and self set of rules will always matter more than anyone else's to me, and nothing changes or can change that.
